## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the lenders to understand their customers better. This dashboard provides an overview of loan patterns across different borrower types. A few key takeaways from the visual:

Loan Purpose: 
Home and business loans dominate in terms of total amount borrowed, while “Other” categories account for the least.

Employment & Income: Full-time employees have the highest average income.
Unemployed individuals have the lowest income and the highest default rate at 3.39%.
Default rates decrease as employment stability increases, with full-time workers showing the lowest rate at 2.36%.

Age Trends: Adults take the largest average loan amounts.
Teens borrow the least, which may reflect stricter lending policies for younger borrowers.

Default by Year:The default rate peaked in 2016 (11.75%) and dropped sharply in 2017, before slightly increasing again in 2018.

This visual analysis helps identify at-risk borrower groups and supports better lending decisions based on employment type, age, and loan usage.
